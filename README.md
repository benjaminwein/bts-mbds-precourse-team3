# Project Description / Abstract

We will go through two main stages for this project. The first one will be Data collection, which consists of 
assigning data to each variable that will be useful for the second part of the project:  Analysis and visualization. 
In this second part we will extract some statistics and perform graphs to ultimately be able to state some conclusions about it.

# Dataset

The Dataset is called Titanic and includes several variables. Variables considered are: PassengerId (type should be integers), 
Survived (Survived or Not), Pclass (Class of Travel), Name (Name of Passenger), Sex, Gende, Age, SibSp (Number of Sibling/Spouse abord), 
Parch (Number of Parent/Child abord), Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked (The port in which a passenger has embarked. C - Cherbourg, 
S - Southampton, Q = Queenstown).
